# IOT-STREETLIGHT

This project implements an IoT-based system for controlling streetlights efficiently. 
It utilizes sensors and IoT technology to dynamically adjust streetlight intensity based on surrounding ambient light levels. 
This improves energy efficiency and reduces light pollution by ensuring streetlights are only at full brightness when needed.
